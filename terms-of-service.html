                <p>Welcome to Chill Bill! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Chill Bill mobile application (the "App") provided by Chill Bill App ("we," "us," or "our"). By downloading, accessing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.</p>
                <p>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY, AS THEY CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, REMEDIES, AND OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING VARIOUS LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS.</p>

                <h3>1. Description of Service</h3>
                <p>The App provides functionality to create invoices and quotes using voice input. It utilizes on-device Artificial Intelligence (AI) for voice recognition and parsing of invoice details. The App is designed for use by freelancers and small businesses. Data processing for core features primarily occurs on your device.</p>

                <p><strong>Accuracy of AI Parsing:</strong> You acknowledge that the App uses AI-powered voice recognition and data extraction technologies. While we strive for high accuracy, these technologies are not infallible and **may occasionally generate incorrect, incomplete, or misinterpreted information on your invoices or quotes.** Errors can occur in transcribing speech, numbers, names, or other details.</p>
                <p><strong>User Verification Required:</strong> **YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING, VERIFYING, AND CONFIRMING THE ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS OF ALL INFORMATION ON ANY INVOICE OR QUOTE GENERATED OR DRAFTED BY THE APP BEFORE SENDING, SHARING, OR RELYING ON IT IN ANY WAY.** This includes, but is not limited to, customer details, line items, descriptions, quantities, prices, totals, tax information, and payment terms.</p>
                <p><strong>No Professional Advice:</strong> The App is a productivity tool and does not provide financial, accounting, tax, or legal advice. Any suggestions, templates, or defaults provided by the App are for convenience only. You are responsible for ensuring your invoices and quotes comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and contractual obligations. Consult with a qualified professional for specific advice.</p>
                <p>By using the App, you agree that any reliance on unverified AI-generated content is at your own risk.</p>
