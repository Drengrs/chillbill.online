*   **Screenshots:**
    *   **First 2-3:** Must showcase voice invoicing (e.g., UI with mic icon, waveform, text overlay "Speak to Create Invoices") and offline capability (e.g., "Works Offline - No Internet Needed!").
    *   Highlight benefits in captions: "Invoice in Seconds, Hands-Free," "Your Data Stays On Your Device."
    *   Show a professional-looking generated PDF.
*   **App Icon:** Ensure it's simple, professional, and hints at invoicing or voice.
*   **App Preview Video (Optional but Recommended):** A short (15-30s) video demonstrating voice input to invoice creation would be highly effective.
