                <details>
                    <summary>How can I get the best voice recognition results?</summary>
                    <div>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Speak Clearly:</strong> Enunciate clearly and speak at a moderate pace.</li>
                            <li><strong>Quiet Environment:</strong> Record in a quiet place to minimize background noise.</li>
                            <li><strong>Key Information First:</strong> Start with essential details like customer name and reference number.</li>
                            <li><strong>Line Items:</strong> State each item clearly, including description, quantity, and price.</li>
                            <li><strong>Natural Language:</strong> Speak naturally; rigid commands aren't necessary.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Does the app learn from my edits?</summary>
                    <div>Yes! Chill Bill learns from corrections you make to extracted invoice details. This helps improve parsing accuracy over time. This learning process happens entirely on your device to protect your privacy.</div>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>What's the best way to describe line items?</summary>
                    <div>
                        For best results, use a consistent format like: "Item: Design work, Quantity: 5 hours, Price: 100 dollars per hour". The app will automatically calculate totals based on the quantities and prices you provide.
                    </div>
                </details>
                
                <details>
                    <summary>Is my voice data secure?</summary>
                    <div>
                        Yes! Your voice recordings are processed securely on your device for privacy. They are never sent to our servers or stored beyond the processing needed to extract the invoice details.
